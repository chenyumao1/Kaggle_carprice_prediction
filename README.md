# Kaggle Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
Predict the price of a used car using a dataset of 40,000 used cars. The data includes various features and conditions of each car. The goal is to construct a model that predicts the sale price of a used car based on its features and condition, and use it to generate predictions for a set of unlabeled data.

## Goal
Construct a model to predict the sale price of a used car based on its features and condition.

## Metric
Submissions will be evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A lower RMSE indicates a better model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of detailed information on 40,000 used cars, including:
- **Car Features**: Make, model, year, mileage, etc.
- **Car Condition**: Overall condition, damage, maintenance history, etc.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KaggleCarPricePrediction.git
   cd KaggleCarPricePrediction
